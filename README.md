# Compiler lab
Learning compiler construction labs typically involve hands-on exercises where students build their own miniature compilers from scratch. This often involves implementing key compiler phases like lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation. Students may encounter common challenges like debugging syntax errors, handling ambiguous grammar, and optimizing generated code.
